# GitHub Actions for Azure - Community Values

Below are the distilled values which our community lives by, and pushed our project and peers toward constant improvement.

## Be respectful


## Community First (reframe the heading to be more relevant)

We are here as a community first, our allegiance is to the intentional stewardship of the Azure Actions project for the benefit of all its members and users everywhere.  We support working together publicly for the common goal of a vibrant interoperable ecosystem providing an excellent experience for our users. Individuals gain status through work, companies gain status through their commitments to support this community and fund the resources necessary for the project  to operate.

## Distribution of Decision making, Ownership

The scale of the Azure Actions project is only viable through high-trust and high-visibility distribution of work, which includes delegation of authority, decision making, technical design, code ownership, and documentation.  Distributed asynchronous ownership, collaboration, communication and decision making are the cornerstone of our world-wide community.

## Default to transparency (revisit the content to reflect more of transparency)

Broadly successful and useful technology requires different perspectives and skill sets which can only be heard in a welcoming and respectful environment.  Community membership is a privilege, not a right. Community Leadership is earned through effort, scope, quality, quantity, and duration of contributions. Our community shows respect for the time and effort put into a discussion regardless of where a contributor is on their growth path.

## Evolution is better than stagnation

Openness to new ideas and studied technological evolution make Azure Actions a stronger project.  Continual improvement, servant leadership, mentorship and respect are the foundations of the Azure Actions project culture. It is the duty for leaders in the GitHub Action for Azure community to find, sponsor, and promote new community members. Leaders should expect to step aside. Community members should expect to step up.
